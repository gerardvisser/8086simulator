1. There can only be a + between a register and a numerical expression, within
   a pointer operand.  This means that something like:

     inc [bp + si - 2]

   will be marked as an error.  Workaround:

     inc [bp + si + -2]

   is accepted.
   The error is triggered in function createPointerOperand in file
   statementCreator.cpp.

2. The line number reported in an error message is one too few (0 based).
